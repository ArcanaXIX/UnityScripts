Leo's Unity scripts

I've written a lot of janky code that will never see the light of anyone else's computer screens, but this is a collection of scripts I've written that I think may be generally useful. Well, I say that as if there is more than just one right now. Right now all I have is a seamless audio looping script so you can loop an audio file with a reverb tail without using middleware like Wwise. If I write more generally useful scripts like that I'll add them here.
